**Requirements**
Node: v20.15.0

**Project Setup**
1. Copy .env.example and rename it to .env
2. Fill out the env variables, you may also skip step 1 and 2 since a default .env has been added to repo.
3. Run "npm install" or "npm ci", later is recommended to avoid any dependency conflicts.
4. Run "npm run dev"
